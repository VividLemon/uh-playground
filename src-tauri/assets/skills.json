Hide uses the TN Match rules for resolution versus Perception. It is impossible to Hide if under casual or direct observation; a momentary distraction may justify use... The mechanic used for Hide is TN match with best Perception. The observer needs to match the TN established by the hider to see the person hiding. If they miss by one shift, they know the space is occupied. If the observer misses by two shifts, they know the direction someone is hiding. If they TN match is missed by more than two shifts, the person is concealed...
